# Bundle war deploy sample
This sample demonstrates how you can add to an existing pom.xml of a war project that already exists.
Everything within the demo-war directory would be an existing Maven project. The additional step to publish this to CICS is the additional plugin in the pom.xml: 

## Set Up
### Have your system programmer create your bundle definition in CSD
Your system programmer should create a bundle definition in CSD and tell you the CSD group and bundle definition name they have used.
The bundle directory of your bundle definition should be set as follows: `<bundle_deploy_root>/<bundle_id>_<bundle_version>`.Â  So for this sample, if your bundle_deploy_root was `/u/someuser/bundles/`, the bundle directory would be `/u/someuser/bundles/demo-war_0.0.1`.

## Using the sample
Clone the sample into your preferred IDE

Edit the variables from the below block in demo-war/pom.xml to match the CSD group, CICSplex, region and bundle definition name.
